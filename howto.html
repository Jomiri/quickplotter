            <h2>How to plot effectively with Quickplotter?</h2>
            <p>This guide includes several tips and tricks that go beyond the simple tooltips on the main page
                and help you to make the most of Quickplotter. </p>

            <div class='text-block'><h3>Function transformations</h3>
                <p>The custom functions allow flexibility in mutating the x- and y-values before plotting while keeping the
                    original imported data unchanged. Here are some common questions and
                    use cases related to function transformations:</p>

                <h4>Which mathematical expressions are recognized?</h4>
                <p>Quickplotter uses math.js for parsing the mathematical expressions in data transformations and
                    curve fitting. Check the <a href='http://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html'>reference</a>
                    for the supported functions and operators.</p>

                <h4>How to normalize y-values between 0 and 1?</h4>
                <p>Use the following transformation <b>(y - min(y)) / (max(y) - min(y))</b>.</p>

                <h4>How to shift the center of x-values to zero?</h4>
                <p>If the x-coordinates are evenly spaced, the simple transformation <b>x - mean(x)</b>
                    works. In the general case, use <b>x - (max(x) - min(x))/2</b>.</p>

                <h4>How to plot linear scale y-values in dB-scale?</h4>
                <p>Quickplotter does not yet support plotting the axes in logarithmic scale but you can use a function
                    transformation to make the data logarithmic. The following function works: <b>10*log10(y)</b>.
                    Negative or zero y-values are illegal arguments to logarithm and result in NaN:s which are dropped
                    out before plotting.</p>

                <h4>How to use logarithm to explore power laws in your data?</h4>
                <p>Suppose you have dataset that you believe obeys a power law <b>y = ax^k</b> and you want to find
                    the parameters <b>a</b> and <b>k</b>. Instead of turning straight into curve fitting, it makes
                    sense to first transform your data into log-scale with <b>log(x)</b> and <b>log(y)</b>. Now your function
                    has to form <b>log(y) = k*log(x) + log(a)</b> and you can use a linear fit to find the slope =
                    <b>k</b> and intercept = <b>log(a)</b> easily. </p>

                <h4>How to draw mathematical functions?</h4>
                <p>Quickplotter is not a graphing calculator but you can use the custom function transformation to plot
                    pure mathematical functions, such as <b>f(x) = exp(x)</b>, if you import linearly spaced data. For example,
                    you can generate two columns with x=y=1,2,...,100 in Excel and then transform the y-values in Quickplotter
                    to exp(y).</p>

                <h3>Unicode characters</h3>
                <h4>How to write Unicode characters?</h4>
                <p>The graph title, axis labels and legend entries can render Unicode characters given as HTML entities
                    or decimal or hexadecimal references. At the moment, the legend position is not correctly calculated
                    if the legend contains special Unicode characters.
                    See this <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_utf8.asp'>link</a> or google for
                    a reference of possible character codes.</p>

                <h4>Greek letters</h4>
                <p>Greek letters have their own HTML entities so they are easy to remember. For example, a lowercase
                    alpha (&alpha;) is <b>&amp;alpha;</b> and an uppercase sigma (&Sigma;) is <b>&amp;Sigma;</b>.
                    Greek letters look much nicer in serif-fonts, such as Times New Roman.</p>

                <h4>Characters without an HTML entity</h4>
                <p>If a character does not have an HTML entity, you can use its numeric reference. For example,
                    <b>&amp;#8723;</b> draws the minus-plus sign (&#8723;).
                    In principle, you can use any character, even the Snowman (&#9924; = <b>&amp;#9924;</b>), though
                    I doubt you will need it.</p>

                <h3>Importing and exporting</h3>

                <h4>How to import data?</h4>
                <p>You can import data either by copy-pasting or drag-and-dropping into the figure area.
                    The drag-and-drop method allows importing multiple files simultaneously. If you want to import error
                    values, select the correct import format first.</p>

                <h4>How to export data?</h4>
                <p>Quickplotter provides three export options: PNG figure for instant use, SVG figure for further modification
                    and CSV data file to save transformed raw data or fitted curves. </p>

                <h4>How to edit the figure generated by Quickplotter?</h4>
                <p>Quickplotter aims to provide the most commonly used styling options but f you want full-control over the
                    look of you graph, you can export it in SVG-format for post-processing in a vector graphics editor.
                    The free, open source, cross-platform editor <a href='https://inkscape.org/en/'>Inkscape.</a> is a
                    great option. Please use the newest version of Inkscape, 0.92.
                    In addition to styling, you can use Inkscape to
                    add annotations to your graphs or combine several graphs into a single file.
                </p>

                <h4>How to export a figure with a certain aspect ratio?</h4>
                <p>By default, the figure fills the entire available area in the browser window and the exported figure
                    will inherit these dimensions. You can use the "fix aspect ratio" option to uncouple the aspect ratio
                    from the browser window. If you need a figure with exact pixel dimensions, you can export as SVG
                    and scale the figure in Inkscape.</p>

                <h3>How to give feedback or suggest new features?</h3>
                <p>If you find Quickplotter useful, or if you feel that some essential feature is missing, I'd like to
                    hear about it. You can email me (the address is in the side bar) or open a new issue on GitHub.
                    Your suggestion has a good change of being heard.
                    For example, the error bar plotting was added based on user feedback.</p>
